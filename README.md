# Madlibs Activity
For this activity, you will use what you've learned about git to work collaboratively.
We're going to write some funny [Madlibs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs)-style stories.

## How To Setup This Activity

1) Form a group with your neighbors. You should choose one person whose computer you will use. Only
one person needs to follow these instructions (but all should read them 🤣)

2) Fork this starter repository on GitHub. Forking means to make a copy of the code but attach it to your own GitHub repository so that you can make changes.
Technically you are "cloning" the starter repo. GitHub calls this "forking" because they add some other
bells and whistles on top. You should see a grey button at the top that says "fork"---that is what you want. If you need more information, look at [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

3) Open a new "CodeSpace" on GitHub. This will start an in-browser
instance of the popular Visual Studio Code editor. (If you're a ninja,
clearly do whatever you want instead.)

4) Right-click on the `index.html` file and then click "Show Preview". You can either make it public or preview in browser. It doesn't matter.

6) Take a look around at the files. Familiarize yourself where everything lives. 

5) Create new stories, verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs! The instructor will likely
assign you to one of these. Checkout a new branch with a good name before you do your work. This will be a command like

```
git checkout -b bald-chicken-new-verbs
```

Here, I named my branch "bald-chicken-new-verbs". You should name yours something *different*, no spaces. E.g.
your branch name might be "fire-lion-new-stories" or "rad-verbs-for-class-by-sleek-deer".


7) Create a new file. You can also edit existing files, but that will make our merging harder! If you want to make a new file of verbs, you might make a file at
`/js/verbs/bald-chicken.js` and in that file, add new verbs.

You should choose a name other than "bald-chicken.js". 

8) If you added a new file, make sure you include it from `index.html`.

8) Check your code works. Did you break the app? No? Great! (You can check the preview to see if it works as expected. Do you see your new content? Also you can run `npm test` from the terminal to run some automated sanity tests.)

9) Commit your changes and share them

    First, take a look at the status of your work

    ```
    git status
    ```

    It should show what files are new and what files are changed. Now, you want
    to add the new files, try the `git add` command. You'll need to supply a file name.

    Once you've added your changes to the "staging area", you want to make a commit. This
    is a command like

    ```
    git commit -m "Added some verbs for class"
    ```

    Now, push your changes up to GitHub.

    ```
    git push origin BRANCHNAME
    ```

    where `BRANCHNAME` is the name of your branch.

10) Go to GitHub, find your fork and the new branch, then make a pull request

    Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

    Click on the logo at right to get started.
    ![Starting the pull request](https://github.com/yale-cpsc-113/CPSC113-madlibs/blob/main/images/pull.png).
    Then, once you get to another page, click the blue link.
    ![Continuing the pull request](https://github.com/yale-cpsc-113/CPSC113-madlibs/blob/main/images/pull2.png)

    Finally, click the create button to checkout the commit.

    If you need extra help, check this out [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) or just come see a TA.

11) The instructor will merge in everybody's work.
